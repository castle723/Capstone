So I decided to double up my capstone and my portfolio into one. My Portfolio as it is to be actually used can be found here https://jacobs-pportfolio.netlify.app/#/ (code here: https://github.com/castle723/portfolio.git). Since there was no real reason to have both sign in/signup and a get and delete operation within my portfolio and that is required for this assignment, I have cloned this project in order to add a dashboard where the data can be retrieved and deleted. I have a very similar backend framework to what we used for the phonebook however I really pushed myself to learn new things on the frontend design. This can be seen in the animation on my home page which I learned from delving deep into a variety of animation frameworks and databases. It can also be seen in my overall stylation of the website and even in my newly learned ability to customize the MUI textfield (which took a suprising amount of time and effort to figure out). The contact functionality within my base website simply allows people to submit their contact data which will be stored into my DB and I can check periodically, in this version I am simply completing the required crud and signin/signout requirements as I believe the rest of what I have done has already taken me to the "above and beyond" benchmark.
